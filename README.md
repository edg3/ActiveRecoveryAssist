# ActiveRecoveryAssist
A be-all, end-all, solution to promote recovery from injuries (primary focus, my own TBI); and keep the patient active with family members. For the Geekulcha &amp; GitHub

This was chosen for the Hackathon for **GitHub Constellation South Africa 2024** run by GitHub: https://githubconstellation.com/

## Description
Chatted a bit to copilot got the broad idea started. Using the prompt to ask for suggested full-stack solutions that can help people who need help, it led me to side towards helping someone who suffers from my own disability. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a difficult problem to ever solve. The goal is to take the suggested sections, and make a full app/service/helper for recovery tasks that seem odd to people who haven't experienced this dissability.

The main suggestions for TBI were:
- Cognitive Rehabilitation App: An app designed to help individuals with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) improve their cognitive functions through exercises and games.
- Memory Aid App: A tool to assist TBI patients with memory challenges by providing reminders, notes, and organizational tools.
- Speech Therapy App: An application that offers speech therapy exercises and activities to help TBI patients improve their communication skills.
- Mood Tracking and Management App: An app that helps individuals with TBI monitor their mood and provides strategies to manage emotional changes.
- Physical Therapy Guidance App: A platform that provides guided physical therapy exercises tailored for individuals recovering from TBI.
- Social Skills Training App: An app that helps TBI patients improve their social interactions and communication through simulated scenarios and feedback.
- Daily Living Skills App: A tool to assist TBI patients in managing daily tasks and routines, promoting independence and self-sufficiency.
- Personalized Recovery Plan App: An app that creates customized recovery plans for TBI patients, tracking progress and adjusting goals as needed.

The other focus was to focus on using copilot more, and the following suggestions were given (all through my subscription, mind you, GPT4o based):

1. **Code Completion**: GitHub Copilot can help you write code faster by providing intelligent code completions. As you type, it suggests code snippets and entire functions based on the context.
2. **Documentation**: Use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for your code. It can help you write comments, README files, and other documentation by suggesting relevant text.
3. **Learning New APIs**: If you're using a new library or API, GitHub Copilot can suggest how to use it by providing example code snippets.
4. **Debugging Assistance**: When you encounter errors, GitHub Copilot can suggest possible fixes and improvements to your code.
5. **Refactoring**: Use GitHub Copilot to refactor your code. It can suggest more efficient or cleaner ways to write your existing code.
6. **Unit Tests**: Generate unit tests for your functions and methods. GitHub Copilot can help you write tests to ensure your code works as expected.
7. **Exploring Alternatives**: If you're unsure about the best way to implement a feature, GitHub Copilot can provide multiple suggestions, allowing you to choose the best one.
8. **Learning Best Practices**: GitHub Copilot often suggests code that follows best practices, helping you to write better and more maintainable code.

## Project Inspiration
An easy way to help people recover. Sometimes the mind needs a little help!

## Technologies in use
Primary: C# (Uno Platform, for V1 on Android and Web) / Azure (Data interop)

Possibly: Python (ML API, model selection will be difficult) / Asp.NET (Uncertain)

## Solution (Make an app and website that offer helpers for habits that help with TBI recovery as a whole.)
Make an app and website that offer helpers for habits that help with TBI recovery as a whole.

## Persona Essence (Who are they, age, how do they access the internet)
A super easy to use interface for someone who suffered from a Traumatic Brain Injury to have fast methods to work towards a greater recovery.

## Customer Segments (What are groups of customers you are targetting)
The aim, using Uno Platform, is to get it on every device possible, and with that it could even have companies donate Android devices with Sims to access both the app, website, and the internet. The wanted future AI addition might not make it onto devices themselves, just need to work out the right balance.

## Unique Value Proposition (Why is this solution different from others?)
Fellow victims of Traumatic Brain Injuries. I spent 8 years on recovery, have many more to come, and I want to bring them back stronger.

## Metrics Measure (What numbers are you targeting? E.g. Users, revenue, jobs, etc)
Everything is mostly pay gated, you can't do it in your own time, in your own way. I'm one who promotes the open public accessible measure for recovery, especially, because not everyone can afford high-cost recoveries. Making it work everywhere, for everyone, with ease, on any device it can - free - will help more where some never even have family or friends to help them.

## Unfair Advantage (What makes it non-replicable?)
My recovery had a lot paid for, high amounts, I was super lucky. I know how difficult it can be to recover; how difficult it can be to add 2 and 2 together for recovery. The costs for recovery professionally are way too exorbitant and high to help victims even WANT to go for it. With their family in control, the money gets kept from them because they haven't recovered yet, so is in control of the family. It has the detrimental effect that most people don't care about recovery, and try to keep it

## Distribution Channels (How the solution will get to the hands of users)
I have friends in all the doctors at the hospitals and recovery centres I went to, and some wouldn't mind spreading the word, as well as I will do all promotions to all hospitals and recovery centres I can if this proof of concept shows good enough results. Then I can take it to business level, and do full release to public.

## Code Structure (Estimate costs [Put figures, e.g R26 000p/y on hosting] such as human resources, computers, hosting, etc.)
I'm on my free Azure tier so have no cost involved to start it. Uno Platform is open source to a degree, and I'm using community VS2022. If the use goes super high, the average cost for Azure SQL Server is $1,866.786 per month. That equates to around R 32 834,53 per month, or rounding just under R400 000 a year. With the average at 111 per 100,000 population having a TBI and needing recovery, at around 8.2 billion people it takes it to 0.111% of the world population, its R44k a year, or R3.7k/mo

## Revenue Streams (How much will you charge? If product, specify unit cost [(]e.g R29p/m susbcription])
If I can get this going and it takes on high use, I want to open a NPO to help others. I can have the NPO allow donations to cover the cost and upgrades in the future, I don't want to ask people for money. I know it's super expensive for recovery, and every time anything has helped it has cost too much to be available to others, I want to offer the first stepping stone for free to them, rather.
