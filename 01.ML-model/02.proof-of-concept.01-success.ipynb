    "Unfortunately, with the AI *.ipynb* files losing working code too fast at the moment, it means copilot has a lot of old flawed examples to help with. It will take more than the hackathon time to get the right solution together using the model I wanted to use.\n",

    "That being said, there are at least models that can fit [Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) should be a good model to train as the assistant (training in the future should be fine from copliot generated code in *01*, just needs work, mostly on prompts my side). We shall see in the future."
